=head1 DESCRIPTION

Running binary C<distrolint> on a distribution repository can be very helpful
during preparation or maintenance by a distribution author. Run the binary 
without any arguments to see its current capabilities. The current 
capabilities are:

=item Reports the distribution's list of other distribution's
      being 'used' in the 'META6.json' file's list versus those actually 
      being 'used' in the 'bin', 'sbin', and 'rakumod' files.

Please file an issue if you would like other capabilities added.
